# Holoplus Mocked API

**IMPORTANT: This is currently incomplete and covers mostly only `GET` endpoints!**

Mock version of the `api.holoplus.com` API. **Based on the `3.0.0` version fo the API.**

The main purpose of this project is to document the API, to make it easier to develop apps that need to access it.
It should also be useful for testing.

Built docs can be found here: https://kunesj.github.io/holoplus-resources


## Quick Setup

Install:

- Use `uv` with Python 3.11+

```

Generated documentation can be found at http://127.0.0.1:8080/schema.

### Inspecting Holoplus requests

- Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Install [HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.com/)
- Install `adb` (`sudo apt install adb` on Ubuntu)
- [Create](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds) new virtual device in Android Studio and make sure to select "Google APIs" services (Google Play must not be installed)
- Start the emulator, and enable root with `adb root`
- [Download Holoplus XAPK](https://apkpure.com/holoplus/com.cover_corp.holoplus), open it as archive and extract `*.apk` files
- Install Holoplus with `adb install-multiple -r "com.cover_corp.holoplus.apk" "config.arm64_v8a.apk" "config.en.apk" "config.fr.apk" "config.mdpi.apk"`
- Open HTTP Toolkit and select to connect to Android over adb. Follow instructions on screen. Everything should be green.
- Open Holoplus app and do something, the requests should be visible in HTTP Toolkit.
